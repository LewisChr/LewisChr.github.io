<h1>The Western World</h1>
<p>"Nah, I don't like it". "What do you mean you don't like it?" Rob asks. "I mean it ain't something I like, Rob" you calmly reply. "Fine, we'll do it ourselves, but I sure hope you don't mind that young family of yours going hungry".</p>
<p>"I'm sure a hungry family is better than a dad-less one" you say. You don't talk to any of the guys for the rest of the night. "Jim, you did the right thing" Arthur tells you. "Don't I know it".</p>
<p>A couple of hours later the guys leave, and you and Arthur stay put, talking about the bits of last night you actually are able to remember, and being filled in about the rest of it.</p>
<p>You guys share some laughs for a while, it always feels good to be able to talk to Arthur about anything you want, however the feel good of it started waring off the longer the night went on</p>
<p>A few more hours later, and there is a sense of fear between the two of you. Arthur is pacing up and down by the camp fire, staring at his pocket watch. "Should they be here by now?" you ask him. "They should have been here over an hour ago now" he replies, his tone not so laid back as it always is.</p>
<p>"Well Arthur, it looks like we were right". "Sure is starting to look that way Jim, though I wish it wouldn't". You decided to wait at camp, as it would be your best chance of finding others that are still alive. After some time, your not sure how long because you lost track of time a long ago, you see a figure approaching.</p>
<p>He gets closer, and you see it's John. He's holding his stomach in an attempt to stop the blood pouring out from his apparent bullet wound. Me and Arthur get up and sprint towards him, reaching him just in time to catch him from falling. "Oh god, what happened" you manage to get out. Arthur is silent in shock. John coughed some blood before managing to get half a sentence.</p>
<p>"Don't... trust... ugh...". That was it. His body went limpless and his eyes went lifeless. I stared at his lifeless body for a minute, sheer panic taking over me now. "Arthur, help me get his body on that horse. We gotta get outta here". "We can't ride around with a dead man with us" he snapped back. "I'll go in front, you go at the back and we'll try squeeze him between us so it doesn't look suspicious" you said, as you attempt to take control of the situation.</p>
<p>"Why?!" he shouted at me. "Because from what we got out of him, it sounds like there's a traitor. Whoever it is will probably come for us next, and if they see him here instead they'll know we're gonna tell the others. It'll buy us time."</p>
<p>"Hold on a minute Jim. What if we... what if one of us take him about 5 minutes that way on horse" he said, pointing the way John came from. "That way, it looks like he never made it to us". "What about his body?" "We can always come back for it later, but right now John could be a lifeline for us". You think about it. It's sick, but so is propping a corpse up like a living person. It still doesn't sit right with you, however, that he won't get a proper goodbye, and his body will be vulture food.</p>
