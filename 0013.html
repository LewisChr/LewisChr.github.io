<h1>The Western World</h1>
<p>You walk out the jail and mount a horse with one of the guys, the leader of your group. "Hope you ain't eaten in a while, it's a bumpy ride 'n I don't want you spewing your guts on my good shirt"</p>
<p>"Shut up Arthur" you tell him. "What is it you guys got planned anyway?". "It's a train robbery that Rob there got told off a friend off his, and I don't like it one bit".</p>
<p>"Will you quit your moaning, we need money and I found us a way to get money", the man called Rob shouts over. "Jimmy, what do you think?" he shouts over to you.</p>
<p>Rob has always had it in for you, and if todays previous events were up to him, you'd be in that cell for the rest of your life. "What's the catch?"</p>
<p>"No catch, I swear on everything I own". "All you own is the clothes on your back" Arthur quickly snapped at him. "Listen Jim, Greg's in it, John, even young Mike". "I didn't think young Mike was allowed at these things" you say, slightly confused.</p>
<p>"That's just it, it ain't 'one of these things', where blood 'n bullets are spilled. This is a quick, 10 minute job". "Why all the bodies on it then if it's so simple?" you ask. "Because, Jim boy, no matter how well prepared you are how well you plan, and I have prepared extremely well and planned every little detail, there is always a chance something could go wrong, totally random, maybe a couple sheriffs pass us by. Now I've got enough bodies to get it done, but I could sure use the extra man power to speed things up and make it go that much smoother."</p>
<p>After a bit of back and forth between Arthur and Rob, you reach the temporary camp that's been setup, Greg, John and even young Mike waiting for your arrival. "Now Jim", Rob lectures on, "we've gotta go about a half hour before dark. The plan is there will be a passenger train full of people, and a carriage beside it. This ain't no ordinary carriage though, this a jeweller's carriage I done learned."</p>
<p>"The plan is Greg will take young Mike with him to steal the carriage, just to give the boy a feel for it. John's gonna go to the driver's bit of the train and get it started up once I give the signal". "It's called the locomotive" Arthur says condescendignly, and you can't help but let out a smile. "That will be once I've decoupled the back of the train from the passenger section, then I shall ride with them on horseback to make sure nothing goes wrong" Rob continues, seemingly ignoring Arthur.</p>
<p>"I've been watchin' 'em do it so I think I know how, but I've brought a couple 'a sticks 'a dynamite just in case, just blow the entire connecting carriage to hell. Now your job, Jim boy, will be just like a regular mugging on a train, except these people are extremely rich. Once you've filled your pockets, John will stop the train at a particular point, where we will pick you up in the carriage, having brough the contents back up here. And dear Arthur won't even need to lift a finger, not that he does anyway. So what do you say, Jim?"</p>
<p>"Give me a minute" you tell him. He backs off, smiling. You have an uneasy feeling. When is the last time he wanted you involved in anything? Still, you needed the money, and you could probably keep a little something from them to give to your lady later.</p>
