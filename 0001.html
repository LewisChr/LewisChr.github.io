<h1>The Western World</h1>
<p>You wake up in a small room, heavily dissorientated. "Oh man, that's the last time I listen to them fools about drinkin'" you groan to yourself.</p>
<p>There is a sense of familliarity around the room, a deja vu feeling of sorts. You look around and know exactly why. It isn't a room it's a jail cell.</p>
<p>An overweight man with a commically-big mustache, that you didn't notice before, stands from a chair from across the room.</p>
<p>"Must have been some party last night, 'ay boy?" he asks.</p>


<p><a href="0002.html">Ignore him</a></p>
<p><a href="0002.html">Tell him to shut up</a></p>
<p><a href="0003.html">Ask him for water</a></p>
