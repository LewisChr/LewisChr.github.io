<h1>The Western World</h1>
<p>"I get a decent cut?" you ask. "Whatever we as a group earn, we'll split it evenly" he tells you. You pause for a few seconds. "I'm in". Arthur throws his arms in the air in a dissapointed manner.</p>
<p>"Glad to hear it" says Rob. "Now, you better get some rest. You look like you got a bad case a' the barrel fever". You didn't need to be told twice. You laid down and closed your eyes, instantly falling asleep.</p>
<p>It was peaceful. You even had a nice dream. You can't quite remember what about, but it was with better people in a better life. You know deep down that's what you want. Surrounded by good people, with your family, happy.</p>
<p>You're awoken by a single gunshot. You jolt up and look around, just to see Rob, his gun in the air with a hint of smoke coming from it, a big smile forming on his punchable face. You remember why you don't really like him.</p>
<p>"Rise and shine, we got work to do". You get up, still in a daze, and look around. You see Arthur, sitting at the fire, not looking at anyone. You decide to leave him alone for now, and maybe talk to him when you're back.</p>
<p>You grab a revolver, a mask, and a big enough bag to carry some valuables, and you all hit the road. It's eerily quiet, and you don't feel right about the job, however you blame it on still being tired. You arrive at the train, and sure enough the carriage was parked up right outside.</p>
<p>You and John split off from the group, heading towards the back of the train in order to avoid detection. You both wait a couple of minutes to hear the carriage getting stolen, then you both quickly make your way to the passenger carriage, masks on and guns out.</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a robbery, I am going to need all of you to give me your cash, your jewellery and anything else of value you own" you shout, calmly but firmly. John makes his way across to the front of the train, aiming his gun at the passengers in order to try and intimidate them some more.</p>
<p>As everyone was frantically reaching into their pockets and fiddling with whatever valuables they had on their person, the train started to move. "I should of learned my lesson from saying this by now, but it seems everything is actually going to plan" you shout, hoping John isn't too far to hear you.</p>
<p>"It is, but not yours". You turn around, recognising the voice, and get shot twice in the stomach for your troubles. You fall to the ground, partly in disbelief and partly in the pain that comes from two fatal bullet wounds. "You... how could you?" is all you manage to get out.</p>
<p>"Because I, no sorry, we, don't like any of you" the voice says. You feel a great sense of betrayal, as how could he, someone you trusted so much, do this to you, and why? That would prove to be your last thought, as one last bullet proves to finish you off.</p>
<p>You are dead.</p>
