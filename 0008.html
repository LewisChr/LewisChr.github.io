<h1>The Western World</h1>
<p>You wait until the guard is in the cell, then you tackle him out of it. You both roll around for a bit, before he manages to push you away and starts to reach for his gun.</p>
<p>Suddenly the wall on the other side of the jail explodes. A group of masked men with a couple of revolvers and a repeater rifle between them. Even with their faces covered, you recognise them, and know your saved.</p>
<p>"How are ye, boys?" you say with a smile, as the guard is led away from you at gun point, disarmed and locked into another cell. "Hope I wasn't too much trouble, I know you guys are some busy gentlemen."</p>
<p>"We certainly are, there's lots to do without you getting put away for basically nothing, numbskull" one of them say.</p>
<p>"Now c'mon, if we forget about our schedule for a minute, we still need to get out of here. No doubt all that noise will attract some unwanted attention"</p>
