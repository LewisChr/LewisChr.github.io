<p>"Thank you" you say, before downing the little water he gave you. "You know, if your wanting outta here, I'm sure we could negotiate something" he says.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" you ask, knowing exactly what he means. "Well, if you happen to know where those friends of yours are, we could talk about letting you go" he says. "Over my dead body, you-"</p>
<p>You don't get the chance to finish your sentence, as the wall on the other side of the jail explodes. A group of masked men with a couple of revolvers and a repeater rifle between them. Even with their faces covered, you recognise them, and know your saved.</p>
<p>"How are ye, boys?" you say with a smile, as the guard is led away from you at gun point, disarmed and locked into another cell. "Hope I wasn't too much trouble, I know you guys are some busy gentlemen."</p>
<p>"We certainly are, there's lots to do without you getting put away for basically nothing, numbskull" one of them say.</p>
<p>"Now c'mon, if we forget about our schedule for a minute, we still need to get out of here. No doubt all that noise will attract some unwanted attention"</p>
